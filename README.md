## Technology Stack

Note IT employs a robust technology stack for both frontend and backend development:

### Frontend Technologies
1. *HTML (HyperText Markup Language)*: The standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications.
2. *CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)*: Used for styling the HTML elements; it controls layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of the application.
3. *JavaScript (JS)*: A programming language that enables interactive web pages; it allows dynamic content updates without reloading the page.

### Backend Technologies
1. *Flask*: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python that provides flexibility and simplicity for building web applications.
  
### Machine Learning Models
1. *Pegasus*: For natural language processing tasks such as text summarization and content generation.
2. *Hugging Face Transformers*: A library that provides state-of-the-art machine learning models for various NLP tasks.

### Libraries Used
The following libraries are utilized in Note IT:

- requests: For making HTTP requests to external services.
- wikipediaapi: To fetch content from Wikipedia for reference.
- rake_nltk: For keyword extraction from text.
- nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for processing textual data.
- Flask-CORS: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for our Flask application.

## Integration with Intel API and RAG Models

We are integrating Intel API keys into our application workflow alongside the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models we developed. This integration will enhance our capabilities in several ways:

### Intel API Integration

1. *API Keys Management*
   - We will utilize both Attestation API keys and Admin API keys provided by Intel Trust Authority. 
   - Attestation API keys will be used for remote attestation APIs while Admin API keys will manage non-attestation functions such as creating new attestation keys.

2. *User Roles*
   - Different user roles will dictate access levels to these API keys within our application. Tenant admins will have broader access compared to regular users.

3. *Security Measures*
   - We will implement regular rotation schedules for API keys as recommended by Intel. This helps maintain security by minimizing risks associated with key exposure.

4. *Functionality Enhancements*
   - The integration will allow us to leverage Intel’s capabilities in threat detection and response within our note-taking environment.

### RAG Models Development

1. *Contextual Information Retrieval*
   - Our RAG models will retrieve relevant information dynamically based on user queries before generating responses or notes. This ensures that the content generated is not only accurate but also contextually relevant.

2. *Improved User Experience*
   - By combining RAG models’ capabilities with Intel’s APIs, we aim to provide users with enriched content generation experiences where they receive curated information tailored specifically to their needs.

3. *Continuous Learning*
   - Our RAG models will continuously learn from user interactions, improving over time based on feedback loops established through usage patterns.
